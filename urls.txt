Notes: 

 1. I am using my personal AWS account. So I stopped the instances previously
 2. Earlier, prometheus gave me "No Data Points" for disk and memory usage metrics. That's why I did not include them. Added them both now.
3. The backend has some issues with moment-timezone(including the screenshot) which is causing the migration to fail. I fixed it and now the application is functioning
